A reference to a personal website I want to do is Brittany Chiang’s site which is sleek, modern, and showcases both personality and professionalism. Since you want yours modeled exactly like hers, here’s what we’ll do:

🔍 Site Breakdown (Brittany Chiang Style)

Let’s match her site’s structure:
	1.	Landing Section – Your name, title, short tagline.
	2.	About Me – Bio + photo + what you do.
	3.	Experience – Work, internships, or school roles.
	4.	Projects – Showcase your best work with links.
	5.	Contact – Call to action, maybe email + social links.
	6.	Sticky Navigation + Dark Theme + Scroll Animations

🔧 Tech Stack She Uses (We’ll Simplify It)

Her site uses:
	•	React (with components)
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	Framer Motion (for animations)
	•	Markdown for content
	•	Deploys on Vercel

But since you’re coding from scratch, we’ll start simple:

	✅ HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript
Then later, we’ll move into React once you’re comfy.

🛠️ Let’s Start with Step 1: Project Setup

Do this in your terminal:

mkdir my-portfolio
cd my-portfolio
npm init -y
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

Then in your tailwind.config.js, enable dark mode:

module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  content: ['./*.html'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

Create a basic index.html and link Tailwind:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="dark">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Your Name</title>
  <link href="dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body class="bg-gray-900 text-white">
  <section class="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
    <div class="text-center">
      <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-4">Hi, I'm [Your Name]</h1>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-400">Student • Developer • Dreamer</p>
    </div>
  </section>
</body>
</html>

Run Tailwind with:

npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

🔄 Next Steps:
	•	Set up this entire project scaffold?
	•	Build each section step-by-step (like Hero, About, etc)?
	•	Add interactivity and deploy it when ready?

Just say “let’s start building section 1,” and I’ll walk you through the hero/landing page like Brittany’s.
